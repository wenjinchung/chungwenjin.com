# Project Plan — UX Portfolio (HTML/CSS)

This is my personal roadmap for building a static UX portfolio website using HTML and CSS, with the help of Claude Code.  
It outlines the steps, phases, and structure so I always know where I am in the process.

---

## 0. Project Overview
- The site will be completely static: **HTML + CSS only**.
- No JavaScript, no React, no frameworks.
- I will design everything in Figma and export screens as PNG/JPG.
- Claude Code will help translate designs into clean, maintainable code.

---

## 1. Design Preparation
Before coding each page:
- Finalize the layout in Figma  
- Export the page as PNG/JPG  
- Note fonts, colors, spacing (if needed)

Key pages:
- Homepage  
- About page  
- Case study template  
- Additional case studies  
- Mobile variations (optional)

---

## 2. Project Structure
The project will follow a simple, organized structure:

index.html
about.html
case-study-1.html (template for more)
styles/
main.css
assets/
images/


More pages can be added later as needed.

---

## 3. Component-Based Thinking
Even though this is pure HTML/CSS, I will treat recurring elements as components so the design stays consistent.

Common components:
- Navigation bar  
- Footer  
- Hero section  
- Buttons  
- Cards and grids  
- Case study sections (overview, problem, process, outcomes)

This keeps the code tidy and makes updates easier.

---

## 4. Building Each Page
For every page:
1. Export the design from Figma  
2. Use Claude Code to generate the HTML/CSS  
3. Adjust spacing, layout, and typography to match the design  
4. Reuse existing components whenever possible  
5. Keep the style consistent across pages

---

## 5. Responsive Layout
After the desktop pages are done:
- Add mobile and tablet styles using CSS media queries  
- Use my mobile designs from Figma (or define general rules)

---

## 6. Refinement & Polish
Final steps:
- Clean up page structure  
- Ensure consistent spacing and typography  
- Optimize images  
- Review accessibility basics  
- Simplify CSS where possible  

This phase makes the site feel professional.

---

## 7. Deployment
Hosting on GitHub Pages:
- Create a public repository  
- Add the site files  
- Enable GitHub Pages  
- The final website URL will be:  
  `https://<my-username>.github.io/portfolio`

---

## 8. Optional Documentation (For Later)
If the project grows, I may add:
- A simple design system file  
- Notes on spacing, colors, or component patterns  
- A README for GitHub

Not required, but helpful in the future.

---

## 9. Maintenance
After launch:
- Add new case studies  
- Update text and images  
- Refresh sections over time  
- Keep the site simple and lightweight
